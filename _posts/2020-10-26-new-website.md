If you ask why the website has a fresh look, look below the footer.

## What's new?

Everything.  If you look before the website was undergoing it's redesign, it
had nothing, barely even a landing page.  I was stuck on the theme for the site
since none of the built-in themes looked good (to me at least.)

Since it's brand new, it was built from the ground up.  After getting the theme
settled, all that was left was to actually fill in the site.  I suck at that.

This blog post is like a little test for seeing how well the website handles.
Plus getting the documentation in will be a big boost.

## What's next for Ally?

Well, with the website, the documentation and more blog posts will be coming
soon.  After the first pre-release comes out, it will be updated with
information from the bot itself, but we'll see.

For the bot, the first pre release will come out by the end of the year.
After all, it's almost halfway there on the
[Trello board](https://trello.com/b/cjyoYOiC).  And, after that, there is a
light roadmap for what will happen after that, but it isn't public yet because
it may be changed before released.

Anyways, that's all for this blog post.  The next post will be coming soon
about the first pre-release of Ally.  See ya then!
